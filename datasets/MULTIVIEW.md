## üõ¢Ô∏è Wildtrack

**Wildtrack** is a large-scale and high-resolution dataset.

It has been captured with **7 static cameras** in a public open area, and unscripted **dense groups of pedestrians** standing and walking. 

Together with the camera frames, we provide an accurate joint **(extrinsic and intrinsic) calibration**, as well as 7 series of **400 annotated frames** for detection at a rate of **2 frames per second**. 

This results in over **40 000 bounding boxes** delimiting every person present in the area of interest, for a total of more than **300 individuals**.

## üóÑÔ∏è MultiviewX

**MultiviewX** is a *synthetic* Multi-view pedestrian detection dataset. 

It is build using pedestrian models from [PersonX](https://github.com/sxzrt/Dissecting-Person-Re-ID-from-the-Viewpoint-of-Viewpoint), in Unity. 

This dataset covers a square of **16 m x 25 m**. The ground plane is quantized into a **640 x 1000 grid**. 

There are **6 cameras** with **overlapping field-of-view**, each of which outputs a **1080 x 1920 resolution** image. On average, any space will be covered by **4.41 cameras**.

## üõ¢ i.c.sens

This dataset was acquired for the purpose of collaborative pedestrian tracking from multiple viewpoints. 

This dataset consists of **29 image sequences** which capture trajectories of pedestrians from **3 different viewpoints** with **3 stereo camera pairs**. 

Each captured image pair (left and right) has a **global timestamp**. The coressponding image sequences in different views have the same sequence number. 

The **identity number** of a pedestrian is unique and identical across viewpoints.
